# Predicting the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket landing using Machine learning and Data Science 

Space X is evolving to be the most successful company in the technology of reusing the rockets and therby reducing the cost. This capstone project tries to predict the landing of falcon 9 reusable rocket without rocket science and just based on available data and Machine learning.   

The project involves understanding data collection, pre-processing and engineering and the application of ML. All the processes are performed on **IBM Watson studio cloud platform and IBM Db2 SQL cloud database**.

This includes
 - Data Collection through API
 - Data Collection through Web Scraping 
 - Data Wrangling 
 - Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL
 - Exploratory Data Analysis using visualization 
 - Machine Learning Prediction 
 - Comparison between the used Machine Learning Models
